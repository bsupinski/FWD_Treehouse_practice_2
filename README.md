# Techdegree F.E.W.D. Slack Challenge Project

**These projects are not required to complete your Treehouse Techdegree. They are a supplement to your learning and can be great additions to your portfolio as full projects.**

## **Description** - 
`The design team at your company has come to you with some mockups for a potential note taking application your company wants to create; Feather. Feather will have two version LITE and PRO. You're tasked with creating the LITE version of this application from only these mockups and the tools you've gained during your Techdegree. Are you up for the task? `

## **Getting Started**
When downloading this project, you'll receive a folder called `featherLITE`. Inside, you'll find a folder containing the icons used in the mockups. (you can use fontawesome if you rather as these are the same as what you'll find on there.) You'll also find a folder named Mockups. Inside this folder you'll find four mockups. Two are for the mobile experience and two are for tablet and desktop experiences. Each have a 'normal' view and a view with an 'overlay' feature.

# Levels of Success with this project
## **Bronze**
- Code out the mockup completely using only HTML and CSS (Sass would be a plus!);
- Finished product should be responsive and work for all screen sizes.

## Silver
- Use javascript to add in the overlay feature.
- Users are able to close the overlay.

## Gold
- Use Javascript to append a new note to the display once 'add note' is clicked and the new note form is filled out.
 


 Do a great job and the design team will have `featherPRO` mockups for you to design next and your boss may offer you a promotion. ;) Happy coding!
